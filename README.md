# Title

This is just a minimalist Vue template that displays posts from a WordPress REST API endpoint.

## Install

1. Make sure you have `yarn` installed on your machine, and run `yarn install`.
2. Add a WordPress REST API endpoint to the `config.js` file. For example: `https://www.wptavern.com/wp-json/wp/v2`.

## Usage

### Spin Up Locally
Run `yarn run dev` to spin up a running version from localhost.

### Build for Production
Run `yarn run build`.

### Deploy to Netlify
Netlify is amazing, so if you're in need of somewhere to host your own version of this project, I highly recommend it.
