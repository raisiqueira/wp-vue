As a woman, I can deal with the uncertainty, the fear and the doubt that accompany my choices.

It\u2019s the eye rolls and the passive-aggressive comments. It\u2019s the disapproval and judgment that oozes out of every pore of our bodies. And really, <strong>why do we care?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Why do we care if another mother chooses natural childbirth or modern medicine?<\/p>\n<p>Why do we feel so compelled to turn up our noses at how she spends her money or what she wears?<\/p>\n<p>Why are we so appalled when a woman works full-time just weeks after giving birth or stays home full-time when her children are in school all day?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is another woman\u2019s work life and personal life and family\u2019s life and child\u2019s life any of our freaking business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But most of all, <strong>why are we so consumed with the things that divide us instead of the ties that bind us?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Often, the reason we\u2019re so quick to judge other women with decisions different from our own is that <strong>we aren\u2019t completely comfortable with our own choices.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The woman with a full-time office job looks down on the stay-at-home mom while battling her own guilt when she can\u2019t attend every class party and field trip.

It\u2019s fueling the fire of perfectionism and planting seeds of self-doubt. It\u2019s tearing down and dividing us when God calls us to build each other up and be united.<\/p>\n<p>And really, at our core, <strong>all the women I\u2019ve ever met want the same things.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We want a purpose that we can be proud of.<br \/>\nWe want a family that is healthy and happy.<br \/>\nWe want a body that we can feel comfortable in.<br \/>\nWe want a life that we love.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These are the ties that bind us together as women.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How different would our relationships be if we focused on that instead?

First, you need to make sure you\u2019re actually ready to hire someone. And then you want to consider different options for getting the help that you need. Only then are you ready to decide which type of hire you are going to make.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Know You\u2019re Ready to Hire<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re ready to hire a new team member, whether that\u2019s your first or your fifteenth, when three things are true about you and your business.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>You are maxed out.<\/strong> Remember this is your business so you get to decide what your version of maxed out is. Maxed out for you might be 70 hours a week or it might be 25. You get to decide when you\u2019re at max capacity and you\u2019re ready to bring on another person.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>You have the money to pay them.<\/strong> This is a big one! Many people think that you should hire someone first and then hope that they earn their keep. Of course, they should make you more money than they cost you, eventually. But that doesn\u2019t happen overnight.<\/p>\n<p>The first few days or even weeks, your new team member is learning the ropes. They may not produce a return on your investment in them within the first month or more in many cases. However, they are working during this time and it\u2019s your responsibility to pay them. That\u2019s why you need to <em>already<\/em> have the money to pay them for a few months before you hire them. Because they will expect to get paid on Friday\u2014just like you would!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>You want to lead another person.<\/strong> This is also important. Just because your demand is growing and you know that you need help doesn\u2019t mean you have to hire help. Believe it or not, as I talked about in Business Boutique Podcast <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/podcast\/ep-29-creating-passive-income\/\">Episode 29<\/a>, you can still make more money and grow your business without hiring. You might not grow in the same way, but you can still grow.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing on another team member is like having a child in some ways. You\u2019re no longer just the business owner, product creator or service provider. You\u2019re a leader. You\u2019re responsible for hiring, training and leading this person or this team. And don\u2019t take this responsibility lightly! You\u2019re entrusting them with your brand and business, so it\u2019s important you do a good job at this.<\/p>\n<p>This is of course in addition to everything else you\u2019re already doing. Hiring help can allow you to grow your business and reach your goals in new ways, but be careful that you don\u2019t unrealistically think this person is <em>only <\/em>going to take responsibility off of your plate. Because in many ways, they also add a different responsibility to it as well.So if you have the desire to lead, that\u2019s awesome. But if that isn\u2019t how you want to grow, that\u2019s perfectly fine too. Remember: This is your business and you can chase your version of success!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you are maxed out, have the money to pay another team member, and have the desire to lead another person, then it may be time to make your first or next hire. However, before you take that important step, I also want you to consider your options for getting the help you need. I want you to baby step your way into things because when you do that, the risk is lower and the mistakes you make are smaller.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oTPT6jvHFFI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Hiring doesn\u2019t have to be an all-or-nothing thing. You don\u2019t have to choose between sinking with no help or taking a giant leap to bring on a full-time team member with all of the cost and commitment that that involves. You have several options for getting the help you need, so let\u2019s look at each of them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Types of Employment to Consider<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are many ways for you to get the help that you need to grow your business and reach your goals. Here are four of the most common positions for you to consider in order to make the decision that\u2019s right for you and your business.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Full-Time Employee<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When you hire someone full time, you\u2019re making a commitment to that person that they have a permanent position in your business on a full-time basis, which is usually defined by 36\u201340 hours a week every week. You can structure their pay however you want to, but the most common is based on an hourly rate or an annual salary, not including commission-based structures. This type of hire typically has the highest commitment level and the highest cost in payroll and benefits, such as health insurance or paid time off in sick or vacation days. For these same reasons, if it doesn\u2019t work out, letting a full-time employee go can be more complex with legal ramifications to consider.<\/p>\n<p>The expectation from this team member will also be very high because you\u2019re bringing them into your business full time, so they are now a reflection of your brand, your business and your values. They need to not only be a fit for the position but they need to be a fit for your culture. Because of this high level of commitment that you offer the team member, this type of hire also has the potential to give you the greatest loyalty and commitment in return. A full-time team member is almost always more committed to you and your business than a part-time team member. Turnover (when an employee quits) for full-time positions is usually much lower, which is a good thing!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Part-Time Employee<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The next level of hire that you can make is a part-time team member. This is where you hire someone on a permanent basis that works in your business less than 34 hours per week most weeks. The schedule and hours can vary, but if they are categorized as a part-time team member for tax purposes, they need to work less than 34 hours each week.<\/p>\n<p>A part-time team member requires a lower level of commitment and cost than a full-time team member. Commission-based pay aside, part-time team members are usually paid hourly, and that hourly rate is often less than what a full-time team member would expect to make. Because of that, many businesses structure their entire company based on only part-time team members. They want to avoid paying more money in payroll and for full-time benefits.<\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s important to point out that when you offer less money and a lower commitment, you will often get that in return. Part-time team members are almost always less committed than full-time team members. In my experience of leading hundreds of part- and full-time team members, part-time employees don\u2019t take the job as seriously, and as a result, turnover is much higher.<\/p>\n<p>Now that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t get outstanding team members for part-time positions, because you can. There are great examples such as Chick-fil-A, which hires teens for part-time jobs and trains them to be outstanding, mature employees. However, when compared to full-time team members, part-time team members not only require a lower level of commitment from you, they often bring a lower level of commitment to the role as well.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Contract Employee<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When you hire someone on a contract or project basis, it means that you bring someone in to help you for a particular project or period of time. You might have a new product you\u2019re launching or a large event you\u2019re planning, and you need help pulling off that particular thing. When you hire someone on a contract basis, you can structure the hours, schedule, and pay any way that you want to. You can pay them on a project basis, hourly basis, or some other option altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing to keep in mind for hiring contract employees is that you are crystal clear in your expectations on the front end. That\u2019s where the term \u201ccontract\u201d comes into play. You want to draft a contract or agreement that spells out exactly what you\u2019re hiring them to do, the results they are expected to achieve for you, what you will pay them for what period of time, what schedule and hours they are required to work, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"Snippet \">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-quote\">\n\t\t\t\t<span>&ldquo;<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"Snippet-text\">Baby step your way into hiring by starting with a contract employee.                                    <\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n                \t\t\t<ul class=\"Snippet-share\">\n    \t\t\t\t<li class=\"Snippet-shareItem\">\n    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=Baby+step+your+way+into+hiring+by+starting+with+a+contract+employee.+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessboutique.com%2F2017%2F10%2Fhow-to-hire-employees-who-will-grow-your-business%2F+%40ChristyBWright\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2017\/10\/how-to-hire-employees-who-will-grow-your-business\/\" data-description=\"Baby step your way into hiring by starting with a contract employee.\" data-via=\"ChristyBWright\">\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t<svg><use xlink:href=\"#bb-twitter\"\/><\/svg>\n    \t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n    \t\t\t\t<\/li>\n    \t\t\t<\/ul>\n            \t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t\n<p>Though the commitment level is lower for you to hire this type of team member, you could get very high-performing and committed team members. Here\u2019s why: Contract employees might want to do a really great job in order to prove their value to you so that you might consider hiring them on a more permanent basis. Hiring on a contract basis can be a great solution to baby step your way into hiring without the cost and commitment. You can prove that you have the work load and revenue to support another team member before going all in, and you can also begin to experience what it\u2019s like to lead another person.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Temporary Employee<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Similar to a contract employee, a temporary employee is someone that you bring in specifically for a period of time or season. For example, if you have a paddle-board or swim-lesson business, you might want to hire seasonal employees for the summer. You would need to make it clear on the front end that this position is only for the summer months of May through August. Or if you have a retail store or other product-based business, you might bring in extra help for the busy Christmas season.<\/p>\n<p>The pay for this type of position is usually exactly like part-time employees, where team members are paid on an hourly basis. Their schedule during this \u201cseason\u201d can be part time or full time, and you would set their schedule to fit your needs for that period of time. Regardless of if you hire a temporary employee for a part-time or full-time schedule, you just want to make sure that you\u2019re clear with expectations before offering that person the position in your business. Temporary help can be a great solution to get you through crazy seasons without taking on the commitment and cost of bringing someone on board on a permanent basis.<\/p>\n<p>Each of these options\u2014full time, part time, contract and temporary\u2014are the most common types of hires that you can consider for your business. But just because you pick one doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t change it if you want to.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Changing the Type of Position After Making a Hire<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As I mentioned before, I am a big fan of baby stepping your way into things. So just because you decide to take a baby step to hire a contract employee doesn\u2019t mean that you have to stay there. You can always change the type of position after the fact and continue to baby step your way to a higher level of hire and commitment as you\u2019re ready to.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say that you are a wedding planner and you land a huge client. The scope of this wedding is more than you\u2019ve ever done before, and you know you need help. You decide to hire someone to assist you with this particular project and you bring on a contract employee. After a few months of working on this project together, you see what a rock star this person is. Remember what I said at the beginning of this article: If you are maxed out, have the money to pay this person, and want to lead them on a more permanent basis, then you can bring this up with him or her and renegotiate their position. If you both agree on what that change would look like and lay out all of the new specifics about it such as pay, hours, schedule and so on, then you can change their position from contract to part time.<\/p>\n<p>And then fast forward another six months, and let\u2019s say that your business is taking off and you need more help. You can always go through the same transition process to change their position from part time to full time if you want to.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Word of Caution When Hiring: Never Go Backward<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a word of caution for you if you decide to make changes to a position after you\u2019ve made the hire: avoid going backward. If a team member is a good fit for your business and the position is a good fit for them, then you can always increase the level of the position from either temporary or contract to part time, or part time to full time. However, making changes that move backward can be demoralizing, defeating and discouraging for the team member. It\u2019s essentially a demotion, which no one likes!<\/p>\n<p>Unless it\u2019s something that they ask for, such as a mom that wants to work less hours to have more flexibility to be with her family, steps backward feel like exactly what they are\u2014a step backward! It can damage the trust between you and them and have other negative consequences. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you to hire someone for a position with a commitment level that you can\u2019t keep.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, like we\u2019ve covered, baby step your way into it. Only commit to what you can follow through with and only hire for positions you know you really need and can pay for.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Find Good Employees<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You can be the most inspirational leader in the world and have the most motivational mission around, but\u00a0you can\u2019t make someone else care.\u00a0People care (or don\u2019t care) because of<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2014\/09\/the-quality-that-cant-be-taught\/\">who they are<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"Snippet \">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-quote\">\n\t\t\t\t<span>&ldquo;<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"Snippet-text\">You can&#8217;t make someone else care.

But believe it or not, there are some key factors you should consider to help you set the right price for your business. There are also several different strategies you can use that will help you determine the price point where you\u2019ll attract the right customers<em> and<\/em> make the most profit.<\/p>\n<p>First, let\u2019s take a look at five of the most important factors you need to consider to set your price.<\/p>\n<h2>Variables to Consider When Setting Your Prices<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3>Cost of Goods<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Your cost of goods is the amount you pay for the materials used to create your products. If you\u2019re a product-based business and your product is art, for example, then your cost of goods would be the expense of the paint, canvases and frames. If you\u2019re a service-based business, you likely do not have any cost of goods, but you do have expenses, which I\u2019ll explain next.<\/p>\n<p>Did you know the easiest way to increase your profit is to lower your costs? In the video below, I\u2019ll give you two foolproof ways to lower your cost of goods and increase your profit by about 30%!<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VY9W_gvxk3Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3>Expenses<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Your expenses are the other costs you have in order to run your business. Both product- and service-based businesses have expenses. For example, a house cleaner uses Windex and a hairdresser uses shampoo and conditioner. Other costs include operational expenses such as paper for orders, boxes for shipping, overhead expenses like lighting and phone service, gas for deliveries and so on.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3>Time Invested<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Calculating your time, as you probably know from experience, is much more complicated than just adding up the minutes or hours spent creating an actual product; it\u2019s the time invested on anything having to do with your product. This includes the time spent on the phone taking and writing the order, preparing, creating, cleaning up and boxing the order, as well as shipping, sending receipts, billing the order and so on. Those are work hours and you need to include them in your price.<\/p>\n<p>And as soon as your customer starts making changes that require more of your time, the price should change as well. For example, imagine you run an Etsy shop selling those cute banners for birthday parties. You get a request for your best-selling five-foot pink-and-white <em>Happy Birthday<\/em> banner that\u2019s priced at $20, but the customer would like you to add her daughter\u2019s name, <em>Savannah<\/em>, under <em>Happy Birthday<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>You can totally do that!<\/p>\n<p>Once the order goes through, you get a follow-up email that reads: <em>Oh, and can you please extend the length by two feet?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Y\u2019all, this is no longer a $20 banner. You\u2019ve added an additional row of letters and more materials to fill the extra space\u2014so your cost of goods has definitely gone up. But don\u2019t forget about the extra time it will take you to complete the bigger (not to mention customized) project. The moment a customer changes the scope of their order, the cost needs to change as well.<\/p>\n<p><em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2017\/02\/extra-time-means-extra-cost\/\">Extra Time Means Extra Cost<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3>Quality<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Another factor to consider when pricing is the quality you\u2019re providing. If you\u2019re using high-quality materials for your product, you\u2019ll want to charge more to cover those costs and price your product for what it\u2019s worth.<\/p>\n<p>The higher the value of the product or service, the higher you should set your price. For example, Banana Republic and H&amp;M are both places you can buy clothes for the office. I, personally, shop at both when I need new business-casual outfits. But when I\u2019m investing in a classic blazer that I expect to wear for several years, I don\u2019t go to H&amp;M\u2014I go to Banana Republic (or a brand of similar quality). And I pay more for it.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a service-based business, you might be wondering how you determine your level of \u201cquality.\u201d If that&#8217;s you, your quality will depend on your skill level, but the perception of your quality will be determined by a few other things such as years of experience, level of education, portfolio of past clients and any awards and accolades you\u2019ve received. If you\u2019re just starting out, your goal might be to just get clients. You might want to charge below average while you are still gaining experience and establishing your client base, referrals and portfolio. But as your skill level, experience, education, clients or awards increase, your price should increase as well.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"Snippet \">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-quote\">\n\t\t\t\t<span>&ldquo;<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"Snippet-text\">As your skills, experience, education, or awards increase, your price should increase as well.                                    <\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n                \t\t\t<ul class=\"Snippet-share\">\n    \t\t\t\t<li class=\"Snippet-shareItem\">\n    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=As+your+skills%2C+experience%2C+education%2C+or+awards+increase%2C+your+price+should+increase+as+well.+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessboutique.com%2F2017%2F09%2Fpricing-strategies-how-to-set-prices%2F+%40ChristyBWright\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2017\/09\/pricing-strategies-how-to-set-prices\/\" data-description=\"As your skills, experience, education, or awards increase, your price should increase as well.\" data-via=\"ChristyBWright\">\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t<svg><use xlink:href=\"#bb-twitter\"\/><\/svg>\n    \t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n    \t\t\t\t<\/li>\n    \t\t\t<\/ul>\n            \t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t\n<p>The photographer my husband and I used for our wedding was insanely talented but also affordable and within our budget. Then, a few months after our wedding, he was named \u201cBest Photographer in Nashville\u201d by a local magazine. Receiving this award meant he could\u2014and should\u2014raise his prices. So, when my friend used him for her wedding pictures a year later, she ended up paying a lot more than I did! And that was completely appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Like our photographer, the quality and experience you offer will help determine the value of your service. That, in turn, will help you set the right price.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h3>What the Market Will Bear<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It\u2019s important to think about what the market is willing to pay for the product or service you\u2019re providing. In general, the higher your price, the smaller the market that can afford it. The goal is to find the sweet spot that maximizes your profit while maintaining a strong customer base.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is there\u2019s an average selling price for almost everything on the market. That includes Etsy items, handmade items, fabric items and items from a home-based business. It\u2019s just reality. For example, unless your name is Kate Spade or Tory Burch, you probably shouldn\u2019t be charging $600 for a purse just because it took you a long time to make it. It\u2019s not the customer\u2019s fault that you sew as slow as Christmas!<\/p>\n<p>To determine what the average selling price is, take some time to research your competition. That can give you a baseline of what the market will bear for that type of product or service.<\/p>\n<p><em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/podcast\/ep-27-learning-from-your-competition\/\">Podcast Episode 27\u2014Learning From Your Competition<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t rely on just one of these variables to give you the answer you\u2019re looking for. Work through all the variables to help you narrow down your price range. I bet you\u2019ll discover your work is worth more than you think.<\/p>\n<h2>3 Pricing Strategies to Consider<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you know about the different variables that can impact your bottom line, let\u2019s look at some of the most common pricing strategies you can use for your business. Every business is unique, so don\u2019t feel like you have to do exactly what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2016\/08\/the-right-way-to-do-things\/\">someone else is doing<\/a>. Trial and error are a natural part of the process.<\/p>\n<h3>Pricing for Market Penetration<\/h3>\n<p>Pricing for market penetration is a strategy many new businesses use to gain customers early on by offering lower prices than industry standards. But as I\u2019ve said before, this is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2015\/05\/stop-selling-yourself-short\/\">common mistake in small business<\/a>. Once you train your customers to expect lower than average prices, it can be difficult to raise them.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"Snippet \">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-quote\">\n\t\t\t\t<span>&ldquo;<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"Snippet-content\">\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"Snippet-text\">Don&#8217;t train your customers to expect lower than average prices.                                    <\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n                \t\t\t<ul class=\"Snippet-share\">\n    \t\t\t\t<li class=\"Snippet-shareItem\">\n    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=Don%26%238217%3Bt+train+your+customers+to+expect+lower+than+average+prices.+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessboutique.com%2F2017%2F09%2Fpricing-strategies-how-to-set-prices%2F+%40ChristyBWright\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2017\/09\/pricing-strategies-how-to-set-prices\/\" data-description=\"Don&#8217;t train your customers to expect lower than average prices.\" data-via=\"ChristyBWright\">\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t<svg><use xlink:href=\"#bb-twitter\"\/><\/svg>\n    \t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n    \t\t\t\t<\/li>\n    \t\t\t<\/ul>\n            \t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t\n<p>I don\u2019t recommend this strategy for another reason: You\u2019re building your business for the wrong person. Here\u2019s what I mean. Your target market is a group of people that want what you have to offer and are willing to pay the price you charge. When you start out charging significantly lower than what your work is worth or what you plan to charge in the future, you\u2019re attracting the wrong customer. You are also positioning your business and brand as being something that you\u2019re not\u2014cheap.<\/p>\n<p>I only recommend this strategy if you\u2019re a service-based business, such as a photographer, speaker or coach, and you\u2019re totally unknown. You can start out charging less than you plan to in the future, but I recommend that you communicate that to your customers from day one. You can offer \u201cintroductory pricing,\u201d which makes it clear this is not your <em>normal<\/em> price. Then, as soon as you get more credentials, experience or awards, you can gradually raise your prices.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: Generally you\u2019re better off charging what you\u2019re worth on the front end.<\/p>\n<h3>Premium Pricing<\/h3>\n<p>Another pricing strategy is to set prices higher than your competition. This strategy can work really well for small businesses and handmade goods. The key to making it work is showing potential customers <em>why<\/em> your product is worth the higher price tag. Then after you communicate the value, you need to deliver on it! Make it your personal goal to make your products and services actually worth ten times what you\u2019re charging your customers. That\u2019s how you exceed their expectations, create repeat and loyal customers, and earn word-of-mouth marketing because your customers were so happy with their experience and the value that they received.<\/p>\n<h3>Bundle Pricing<\/h3>\n<p>The last strategy I want to share with you is bundle pricing, where you sell multiple products for a lower rate than if they were purchased individually. Using this pricing strategy, your customers get a \u201cbonus\u201d for free, increasing the value in their eyes! Who doesn\u2019t like getting more stuff for less money?<\/p>\n<p>Selling bundles is not only a great way to encourage your customers to spend a little extra cash, but it also helps you clear out previously unsold items in your inventory.

You may have already cut as much as you can from your monthly expenses, but when it comes to making extra money, there\u2019s no limit to what you can do!<\/p>\n<p>I coach women all over the country to help them start side businesses to do just that.<strong> You can turn your hobby or talents into a business that will create additional income for your family <\/strong>to break free from the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle. Now, with platforms like Etsy and PayPal as well as free social media marketing, there is easier access to the marketplace than ever before. Hundreds of side businesses are popping up every day, and people just like you are breaking free from living paycheck to paycheck with the extra income they are earning.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to start a side business, you first need to make sure that your side business is a real business and not just a hobby. The difference between a hobby and a business is that a business <em>makes<\/em> you money and a hobby <em>costs<\/em> you money. This may seem obvious, but many people are out there running \u201cbusinesses\u201d that barely break even.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2016\/05\/the-first-step-to-turning-your-hobby-into-a-business\/\">Related: The First Step to Turning Your Hobby Into a Business<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>So if your side business is going to help you get ahead in your finances, it has to make a profit for you.<\/strong> The best way to make a profit, aside from getting orders of course, is to keep your expenses <em>way <\/em>down. Here are three easy things you can do to keep costs down as you build your business:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use your skills.<br \/>\n<\/strong>What are you naturally good at? What education or experience do you have? Maybe you worked at a florist in high school, so you can start a side business arranging flowers. Maybe you are gifted at music, so you can start a side business teaching lessons.I was always very natural at doing hair updos, so I did contract work for weddings and proms during college to make extra money. But it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea for me to start a side business selling handmade art, since I have no skills or experience in art. I would have to start from scratch and take classes to develop even a basic knowledge . . . and I would still be significantly behind the competition.Instead of starting something entirely new, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2017\/03\/the-gift-we-are-missing-out-on\/\">think of your skills, talents, experience, education and natural gifts<\/a>, and birth your business out of that. You\u2019ll not only keep expenses down, but you\u2019ll be more successful and enjoy it more also!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Start with what you have.<br \/>\n<\/strong>People quickly get overwhelmed with the idea of business because they think of all of the things they \u201cneed\u201d to buy to even get started. But you really don\u2019t need to buy that much. <a href=\"http:\/\/christywright.com\/2014\/08\/what-you-really-need-to-get-your-business-going\/\">What do you already have that you can use?<\/a>When I moved to a 40-acre farm in my early 20s, I needed to earn more money than my entry-level salary at a nonprofit provided in order to pay rent on such a big place. I had an 11-stall barn on the property, so I decided to start a horse-boarding business. I didn\u2019t have to buy anything new other than some feed for the horses, and I was able to bring in more money than I even needed for rent. Start with what you have and you will keep expenses down and launch your business quicker.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Use free marketing.<br \/>\n<\/strong>With the countless free ways to spread the word about your business out there, there\u2019s no reason to pay for advertising when you\u2019re just starting out. You can avoid any marketing expenses by simply using social media platforms, leveraging your current network, and incentivizing referrals from your first customers.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When you build your side business by using your skills, starting with what you have and using free marketing, you\u2019re keeping your expenses as low as possible\u2014which means a larger profit. Remember, it\u2019s that profit that provides more personal income for you.<\/p>\n<p>And who knows? Maybe that little part-time side project that you started to pay off your debts may just turn into a lifelong passion and full-time business!<\/p>\n<p><em>Use my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/profit\/\"><em>Profit Potential tool<\/em><\/a><em> to see how much money your business could make!<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seven out of 10 Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

How do you pull a great story out of an everyday situation?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donald Miller:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All decent writers have one thing in common: They intuitively know what\u2019s interesting. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s James Patterson writing about a murder or Annie Dillard writing about a flower next to a rock. They find what\u2019s interesting and tell their readers about it.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, story formulas act like cheat sheets. In over 2,000 years of studying best practices, storytellers have learned that readers (or viewers) like characters who want something specific. They get more interested when the character just can\u2019t get it, and even more interested when they have to go through pain in their journey to resolve their conflict. So, the key to finding a good story is to know those elements and be able to see them in everyday life. When a woman misses a bus or a little dog on a leash tries to take on a big, towering dog opposite them on the sidewalk, that stuff is story. You just have to leave all the boring stuff out. The desire and the conflict are where the story is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CW:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You help people clarify their message and branding. What is the number one mistake you see business owners make when it comes to that?<\/p>\n<p><strong>DM:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>They don\u2019t communicate clearly. Business leaders try to be clever or cute in their sales and marketing copy, and it backfires. Clarity works. The most effective billboard I see when I\u2019m driving down the road is hot pink with the words \u201cGUN SHOW\u201d printed boldly across the pink. That works. Cute rarely works. It\u2019s amazing to me how many websites I visit for clients and they aren\u2019t even explaining what they offer their customers. A customer has to know, within a few seconds, what problem you can solve for them. If you don\u2019t tell them, they will move on to your competition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CW:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How much would you say clear messaging affects sales?<\/p>\n<p><strong>DM:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen small companies explode after they got their message straight. We\u2019ve seen everything from 10% growth to 400% growth. More companies than we can count have literally doubled in revenue after they attended one of my StoryBrand Workshops. The reason is because their previous marketing efforts were practically invisible. I mean, they had websites and brochures and signs, but none of that stuff was saying anything potential customers could understand. When you get your message clear, it\u2019s like unlocking the front door and turning the sign on the door to read \u201copen.\u201d It\u2019s that important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CW: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What will the women who attend Business Boutique take away from your session?<\/p>\n<p><strong>DM:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I want them to know that if you understand what problem you solve for your customer, and can communicate it clearly, you will be in the top 10% of all businesses everywhere. If you want your business to grow, clarify your message. Clarity is your secret weapon. In my session, I\u2019ll show you a seven-part plan to clarify your message so customers will listen.<\/p>\n<p>* * *<\/p>\n<p>Y\u2019all,<em> 10% to 400% growth<\/em>!

It\u2019s a funny compliment but it\u2019s one of my very favorites. My new friend often says, \u201cI feel like we are best friends!\u201d And since it\u2019s my personal life goal to make everyone my best friend, I feel very happy with this news.<\/p>\n<p>But what they are really saying is, \u201cYou get me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And in business and life, isn\u2019t that one of the best things we can hear from those people we exist to serve? \u201cYou get me.\u201d Connection. Understanding. Empathy. Trust. Support. What gifts those are in any relationship.<\/p>\n<p>But how do you do that? How do you make your customers or your audience feel like you \u201cget\u201d them?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly what I want to teach you in this blog today. If you want to connect with your customers on a completely different and much more meaningful level, you just need to know the answers to two questions.<\/p>\n<p>I have used these two questions in every single coaching session I\u2019ve ever conducted, in every event I\u2019ve ever spoken at, and in every setting in which I needed to influence or lead others. They are two simple questions, but they give you incredible insight into the audience you want to connect with. If you want to lead a group of people, you need to know:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What frustrates them.<\/li>\n<li>What motivates them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That\u2019s it!<\/p>\n<p>You need to know what frustrates them. What problems do they have? What pain points do they experience? What fears, challenges, stresses and worries do they have?<\/p>\n<p>You also need to know what motivates them. What fires them up and gets them excited? What is their <em>why<\/em>? What makes them light up and gets them out of bed in the morning? What makes it all worth it for them?<\/p>\n<p>When you know what frustrates your audience, you can speak to that. This is where you can highlight the problem and you can demonstrate empathy, understanding and compassion. You can offer help, solutions and support.<\/p>\n<p>When you know what motivates your audience, you can speak to that also. You can come alongside them and align yourself with their goals and dreams. You can rally with them, cheer them on and champion them in what matters the most to them.<\/p>\n<p>And this goes without saying, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway: This is not a formula on how to manipulate. These questions are a guide for how to connect with, understand and serve others better. You need to always have an authentic desire to serve and a heart to help. These questions are simply tools in your toolbox to help you be more effective in doing that.<\/p>\n<p>What frustrates them? And what motivates them?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the secret sauce to connecting. <em>(And now, if you pay attention, you\u2019ll catch me speaking to these exact things with the audience I lead!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So as you\u2019re thinking about your customers, start thinking about the answers to these two questions. What frustrates them? And what motivates them? If you can keep that in mind, it will change not only your marketing, sales and customer service, but it can also change your entire relationship with your customers. They may even come up to you when they see you out and hug your neck. But it\u2019s not weird, because even though y\u2019all have never met, you\u2019re totally best friends.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4>Ready to learn about your customers\u2014including what frustrates and motivates them?

This is the final class you have to pass in order to graduate with a degree in Advertising.<\/p>\n<p>At the very beginning of the semester, you get into groups that represent advertising agencies. Each of the groups (agencies) have to spend the entire semester researching and building a campaign for the sole purpose of competing for a client. The professors of the college set the client at the beginning of the semester. At the end of the semester, each group pitches their campaign to the board (client), and one group wins the account.<\/p>\n<p>The client that we had to compete for was the SmartCar Fortwo. This car was not available in the United States at the time, so building a campaign for it was particularly tricky.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the other groups had six members, but we only had five. We named ourselves \u201cParty of Five,\u201d which was pretty appropriate because we had a good time, despite the fact that we did not perform well on most of the early projects and assignments\u2014all of which would go into our final portfolio.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We got discouraged, and you could tell the other groups didn\u2019t take us seriously<\/strong>. We tried to keep a good attitude, because this class was very important and we wanted to do a good job. We just couldn\u2019t seem to complete things as well as the other groups.<\/p>\n<p>During our research phase, we exercised all of the techniques we\u2019d learned in order to identify the target market for the SmartCar Fortwo. We did surveys. We conducted interviews. We held focus groups. The result from all of our research was always the same:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Everyone hated the car.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We were in the mountains of East Tennessee, where everyone drove big trucks! We couldn\u2019t find anyone that liked it. And we couldn\u2019t move forward to build ads for a target market when we couldn\u2019t figure out who they were, why they liked the car, or what they wanted!<\/p>\n<p>So I did what I usually do when I hit a wall: I prayed. I prayed that God would help me lead my group past this dead end so that we could build a competitive campaign. We didn\u2019t have to win, but we had to do better than we had been.<\/p>\n<p>And God answered my prayer.<\/p>\n<p>One late night, I was doing some online research at the library. I came across a petition with 500 signatures to bring the SmartCar to the United States. They loved the car so much that they went online and created a petition to bring it to the US!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gold! This was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessboutique.com\/2016\/08\/who-you-should-sell-to\/\">target market<\/a><\/strong><strong>!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I called my group over and told them that this was our ticket! This was information that (we hoped) no one else had, and it would allow us to build a strong campaign!<\/p>\n<p>We were off! The petition listed the names, cities and states of all of the individuals. We divided up the list, researched phone numbers, and called them to request phone interviews. While some were confused as to how we got their number, most were very kind and cooperative. They answered our 20+ questions and consequently gave us exactly what we needed: insight into our target market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The results were beautifully consistent.<\/strong> They loved the fuel efficiency. They loved how easy it was to park. They loved how practical it was.<\/p>\n<p>Taking their words and understanding their mindset, we spend the rest of the semester building a campaign titled, <strong>\u201cThe SmartCar Fortwo. It just makes sense.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the end of the semester when campaign presentation day came, we were all sweating and stirring with nerves. We watched the other groups present one after another in the big ballroom in front of all of the leaders of the Advertising College. None of the groups had the research that we did. Every other group used people only in Knoxville and based their campaign around only one or two people that <em>kind of<\/em> liked the car.<\/p>\n<p>It was our turn. When we revealed the petition and our methodology for research, you could see every set of eyes in the room widen. We nailed our pitch and sat down waiting nervously for the results.<\/p>\n<p>The Advertising College president came to podium and gave a little speech about how everyone did a great job. Then he cleared his throat and paused, <strong>\u201cAnd the 2005 campaign winner is Party of Five!\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We all stood and screamed and danced like crazy people. All of our hard work had paid off and our prayers were answered.<\/p>\n<p>When I talked to my professor after it was all over, I told her how nervous I had been throughout the semester. We really struggled with some parts and we didn\u2019t have the prettiest ads. Then she said something that I\u2019ll never forget.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThe prettiest ads don\u2019t win the campaign, Christy. The best research wins the campaign.\u201d<\/strong> And she smiled and walked away.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lesson I\u2019ve carried with me and still use even now in my career. The reason the Business Boutique has been a success was because I spent years researching women with side-businesses through hour-long interviews, focus groups and surveys. I tried to understand where they are and what they need.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to have the best marketing for your business, don\u2019t worry about the prettiest ads. Spend some time getting to really know your customers. Ask them what they like about your company and what they don\u2019t. Ask them about their problems and what they need. Ask them about what motivates them and what they want more of. When you <em>get<\/em> them, then you can actually reach them.<\/p>\n<p>Because it\u2019s not the prettiest ads that makes the best marketing. <strong>The best research does.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>* * *<\/h4>\n<p>One way that I research is by using SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) Analysis.
